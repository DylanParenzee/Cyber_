# Cyber_


This will be a study zone/ sandbox for any and all ideas relating to my cybersecurity studies. Going to use the README to keep track of progress and share thoughts along the way.

Essitially completed first unit of studies, have a much more in depth idea of cybersecurity, best practices, common threats, documentation and where to find information. There is a side to documentaion writing and analyising/applying polices and procedures that is deeply similar to what I do as a health and safety manager at my current job. Loving it so far... going to merge my studies with self study of python (deeply, deeply passionate about getting a deeper understanding of AI/machine learning, as well as scripting) while also learning AWS/cloud comuting (Devops is the goal one day!) seems like alot at this point but taking it slow.
