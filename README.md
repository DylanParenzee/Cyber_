This will be a study zone/ sandbox for any and all ideas relating to my cybersecurity studies. Going to use the README to keep track of progress and share thoughts along the way.

Essitially completed first unit of studies, have a much more in depth idea of cybersecurity, best practices, common threats, documentation and where to find information. There is a side to documentaion writing and analyising/applying polices and procedures that is deeply similar to what I do as a health and safety manager at my current job. Loving it so far...
